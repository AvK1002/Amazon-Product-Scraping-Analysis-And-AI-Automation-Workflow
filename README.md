# Amazon-Product-Scraping-Analysis-And-AI-Automation-Workflow
In this project, we scraped sponsored product listings for "soft toys" from Amazon using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. The data was cleaned with pandas and analyzed using seaborn and matplotlib to visualize brand frequency, price vs. rating, and review trends. Results were saved as plots and a cleaned CSV.
